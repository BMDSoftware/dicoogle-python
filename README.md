# dicoogle-python: dicoogle API client


**dicoogle-python** is the official `dicoogle`_ API client for Python.

Dicoogle is an extensible, platform-independent and open-source PACS archive software that replaces the traditional centralized database with a more agile indexing and retrieval mechanism. It was designed to support automatic extraction, indexing and storage of all meta-data detected in medical images, including private DICOM attribute tags, without re-engineering or reconfiguration requirements. This package is provided to better use their APIs in Python code.
